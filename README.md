# tailored-RRob
This repository contains a MATLAB implementation to reproduce the results of [1]. This includes code to load 10 channel-wise invivo 3D B1+ datasets of the human body acquired during deep breathing at 7T as described in [2] and to compute and evaluate tailored non-selective respiration specific and respiration robust kT-points pTx pulses in the human heart [1].

Usage
--------

Run script main.m: This script takes the user through two pulse designs and evaluations as described in [1]. This script shows three cases: 1) default shim setting: phase and equal magnitude set by the coil manufacturer to provide sufficient B1+ throughout the heart and the aorta, 2) tailored-RSpec: tailored for one out of three subject-specific respiration states (inhale, intermediate and exhale) and 3) tailored-RRob: tailored for all three subject-specific respiration states. The functions rely on B1 maps and ROIs available at TBA.

##### Test scripts (run these):
    main.m          TBA

Dependencies
------------
These routines were tested under MATLAB R2019a under Windows, but should also run under older versions.

The 10 channel-wise invivo B1+ datasets of the human body at 7T are available at: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.15172899.v1 and were computed as described in [2].

The optimization of the kT-points is performed using code by Will Grissom and Zhipeng Cao ([3,4] and https://bitbucket.org/wgrissom/acptx/) who have given permission for inclusion within this package.
